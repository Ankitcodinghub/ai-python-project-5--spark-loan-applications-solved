Overview

In P5, we‚Äôll use Spark to analyze loan applications in WI. You‚Äôll load your data to Hive tables and views so you can easily query them. The big table (loans) has many IDs in columns; you‚Äôll need to join these against other tables or views to determine the meaning of these IDs. In addition, you‚Äôll practice training a Decision Tree model to predict loan approval.

Important: you‚Äôll answer 10 questions in P5. Write each question and it‚Äôs number (e.g., ‚Äú#q1: ‚Ä¶‚Äù) as a comment in your notebook prior to each answer so we can easily search your notebook and give you credit for your answers.

Learning objectives:

use Spark‚Äôs RDD, DataFrame, and SQL interfaces to answer question about data load data into Hive for querying with Spark optimize queries with bucketing and caching train a Decision Tree model

Before starting, please revisit the general project directions.

Corrections/Clarifications

Nov 2nd: A hint on q7 on how to join with counties is added.

Cluster Setup

Virtual Machine

~4 GB is barely enough for P5. Brefore you start, take a moment to enable a 1 GB swap file to supplement. A swap file is on storage, but acts as extra memory. This has performance implications as storage is much slower than RAM (as what we have studied in class).

‚Äú`

https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-addswap-space-on-ubuntu-22-04

sudo fallocate -l 1G /swapfile sudo chmod 600 /swapfile sudo mkswap /swapfile sudo swapon /swapfile

htop should show 1 GB of swap beneath memory

‚Äú`

Containers

For this project, you‚Äôll deploy a small cluster of containers:

p5-nb (1 Jupyter container) p5-nn (1 NameNode container) p5-dn (1 DataNode container) p5-boss (1 Spark boss container) p5-worker (2 Spark worker containers)

You should be able to build all these images like this:

docker build . -f p5-base.Dockerfile -t p5-base docker build . -f notebook.Dockerfile -t p5-nb docker build .

-f namenode.Dockerfile -t p5-nn docker build . -f datanode.Dockerfile -t p5-dn docker build . -f boss.Dockerfile -t p5-boss docker build . -f worker.Dockerfile -t p5-worker

We provide most of the Dockerfiles mentioned above, but you‚Äôll need to write boss.Dockerfile and worker.Dockerfile yourself. These Dockerfiles will invoke the Spark boss and workers and will use p5-base as their base Docker image.

To start the Spark boss and workers, you will need to run the start-master.sh and start-worker.sh spark://boss:7077 -c 1 -m

512M commands respectively (you‚Äôll need to specify the full path to these .sh scripts). These scripts launch the Spark boss and workers in the background and then exit. Make sure that the containers do not exit along with the script and instead keep running until manually stopped.

You should then be able to use the docker-compose.yml we proved to run docker compose up -d. Wait a bit and make sure all containers are still running. If some are starting up and then exiting, troubleshoot the reason before proceeding.

Data Setup

Virtual Machine

The Docker Compose setup maps a nb directory into your Jupyter container. Within nb, you need to create a subdirectory called data and fill it with some CSVs you‚Äôll use for the project.

You can run the following on your VM (not in any container):

You‚Äôll probably need to change some permissions (chmod) or run as root (sudo su) to be able to do this.

Jupyter Container

Connect to JupyterLab inside your container, and create a notebook called p5.ipynb. Put your name(s) in a comment at the top.

Run a shell command (hdfs dfs -D dfs.replication=1 -cp -f data/*.csv hdfs://nn:9000/ in a cell to upload the CSVs from the local file system to HDFS).

Part 1: Filtering: RDDs, DataFrames, and Spark

Inside your p5.ipynb notebook, create a Spark session (note we‚Äôre enabling Hive on HDFS):

python from pyspark.sql import SparkSession spark = (SparkSession.builder.appName(‚Äúcs544‚Äù)

.master(‚Äúspark://boss:7077‚Äù) .config(‚Äúspark.executor.memory‚Äù, ‚Äú512M‚Äù) .config(‚Äúspark.sql.warehouse.dir‚Äù, ‚Äúhdfs://nn:9000/user/hive/warehouse‚Äù) .enableHiveSupport() .getOrCreate())

Q1: how many banks contain the word ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in their name, ignoring case? Use an RDD to answer.

The arid2017_to_lei_xref_csv.csv contains the banks, so you can use the following to read it to a DataFrame.

‚Äú`python

TODO: modify to treat the first row as a header TODO: modify to infer the schema

banks_df = spark.read.csv(‚Äúhdfs://nn:9000/arid2017_to_lei_xref_csv.csv‚Äù) ‚Äú`

From this DataFrame, you can use banks_df.rdd to get the underlying RDD you need for this question.

Use a filter transformation (that takes a Python lambda) with a count action to get the answer.

As an practice, you could run this:

python rows = df.rdd.take(3)

The try to extract the name from one of the rows with a little Python code. This will help you determine how to write your lambda (which will take a Row and return a boolean).

Use the some format as previous projects for all your notebook answers (last line of a cell contains an expression giving the answer, and the cell starts with a ‚Äú#q1‚Äù comment, or similar).

Q2: how many banks contain the word ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in their name, ignoring case? Use a DataFrame to answer.

This is the same as Q1, but now you must operate on banks_df itself, without directly accessing the underlying RDD.

https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_like.asp https://www.w3schools.com/sql/func_sqlserver_lower.asp

Q3: how many banks contain the word ‚Äúfirst‚Äù in their name, ignoring case? Use Spark SQL to answer.

To write a SQL query to answer this, we first need to load into a Hive table. You can do so with this:

python banks_df.write.saveAsTable(‚Äúbanks‚Äù, mode=‚Äùoverwrite‚Äù)

Now you can use spark.sql(????) with a SQL query you write to get the answer. This call will return the results as a Spark DataFrame -you‚Äôll need to do a little extra Python work to get this out as a single int for your answer.

Part 2: Hive Data Warehouse

loans table

You have already added a banks table to Hive (using the command we shared with you).

Note that writeTable will produce one or more Parquet files in hdfs://nn:9000/user/hive/warehouse (look back at how you created your Spark session to see this).

Use bucketBy with your writeTable call to create 8 buckets on column county_code. This means that your written data will be broken into 8 buckets/groups, and all the rows will the same county will be in the same bucket/group. This will make some queries faster (for example, if you GROUP BY on county_code, Spark might be able to avoid shuffling/exchanging data across partitions/machines).

Other views

Use createOrReplaceTempView to create Hive views for each of the names in this list:

python [‚Äúethnicity‚Äù, ‚Äúrace‚Äù, ‚Äúsex‚Äù, ‚Äústates‚Äù, ‚Äúcounties‚Äù, ‚Äútracts‚Äù, ‚Äúaction_taken‚Äù, ‚Äúdenial_reason‚Äù, ‚Äúloan_type‚Äù, ‚Äúloan_purpose‚Äù, ‚Äúpreapproval‚Äù, ‚Äúproperty_type‚Äù]

The contents should correspond to the CSV files of the same name in HDFS. Don‚Äôt forget about headers and schema inference!

Q4: what tables are in our warehouse?

You can use spark.sql(‚ÄúSHOW TABLES‚Äù).show() to see your tables in the warehouse as follows.

+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì+ |namespace| tableName|isTemporary| +‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî-+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì+

| default| banks| false| | default| loans| false| | | action_taken| true| | | counties| true| |

|denial_reason| true| | | ethnicity| true| | | loan_purpose| true| | | loan_type| true| | | preapproval| true|

| |property_type| true| | | race| true| | | sex| true| | | states| true| | | tracts| true| +‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî+‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì+ Answer with a Python dict looks like this python {‚Äòbanks‚Äô: False, ‚Äòloans‚Äô: False, ‚Äòaction_taken‚Äô:

True, ‚Äòcounties‚Äô: True, ‚Äòdenial_reason‚Äô: True, ‚Äòethnicity‚Äô: True, ‚Äòloan_purpose‚Äô: True, ‚Äòloan_type‚Äô: True, ‚Äòpreapproval‚Äô: True, ‚Äòproperty_type‚Äô: True, ‚Äòrace‚Äô: True, ‚Äòsex‚Äô: True, ‚Äòstates‚Äô: True, ‚Äòtracts‚Äô: True }

Use an INNER JOIN between banks (banks.lei_2020) and loans (loans.lei) to answer this question. lei in loans lets you identify the bank. Filter on respondent_name (do NOT hardcode the LEI).

Q6: what does .explain(‚Äúformatted‚Äù) tell us about how Spark executes Q5?

Show the output, then write comments (which we will manually grade) explaining the following:

1. Which table is sent to every executor via a BroadcastExchange operation?

Part 3: Grouping Rows

Q7: what are the average interest rates for Wells Fargo applications for the ten counties where Wells Fargo receives the most applications?

Answer Q7 with a Python dict that looks like this:

python {‚ÄòMilwaukee‚Äô: 3.1173465727097907, ‚ÄòWaukesha‚Äô: 2.8758225602027756, ‚ÄòWashington‚Äô: 2.851009389671362,

‚ÄòDane‚Äô: 2.890674955595027, ‚ÄòBrown‚Äô: 3.010949119373777, ‚ÄòRacine‚Äô: 3.099783715012723, ‚ÄòOutagamie‚Äô:

2.979661835748792, ‚ÄòWinnebago‚Äô: 3.0284761904761908, ‚ÄòOzaukee‚Äô: 2.8673765432098772, ‚ÄòSheboygan‚Äô:

2.995511111111111}

The cell following your answer should have a plot that looks like this:

The bars are sorted by the number of applications in each county (for example, most applications are in Milwaukee, Waukesha is second most, etc).

Q8: when computing a MEAN aggregate per group of loans, under what situation (when) do we require network I/O between the partial_mean and mean operations?

Write some simple GROUP BY queries on loans and call .explain(). Try grouping by the county_code. Then try grouping by the lei column.

If a network transfer (network I/O) is necessary for one query but not the other, write a comment explaining why. You might want to look back at how you loaded the data to a Hive table earlier.

Write your answer as a Python comment.

Part 4: Machine Learning

The objective of Part 4 is to use the given loan dataset to train a Decision Tree model that can predict outcomes of loan applications (approved or not). Recall that a loan is approve if action_taken is ‚ÄúLoan originated‚Äù.

We call our label approval, indicating the whether of a loan application is approved or not (1 for approved, 0 otherwise). And for this exercise, we will use the features loan_amount, income, interest_rate in loans table for prediction.

First, as a prepartory step, get the features and label from the loans table into a new dataframe df. Cast the approval, income and interest_rate columns to double type and fill missing values of all features and label columns by 0.0.

Then split df as follows:

‚Äú`python

deterministic split

train, test = df.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2], seed=41) ‚Äú`

Cache the train DataFrame.

Q9. How many loans are approved (approval = 1) in the train DataFrame?

Answer with a single number.

Q10. What is the accuracy of the decision tree classifier of depth 5 on the test dataset?

You‚Äôll need to train a decision tree first. Start with some imports:

python from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler from pyspark.ml.classification import DecisionTreeClassifier

Use the VectorAssembler to combine the feature columns loan_amount, income, interest_rate into a single column.

Train a DecisionTreeClassifier of max depth 5 (and default arguments for other parameters) on your training data to predict approved based on the features.

Use the model to make predictions on the test data. What is the accuracy (fraction of times the model is correct)?

Submission

Be sure to include a comment at the top of notebook with your name (or both names if you worked as partners).

We should be able to run the following on your submission to directly create the mini cluster:

docker compose up -d

We should then be able to open http://localhost:5000/lab, find your notebook, and run it.

Testing

After copying ../tester.py, ../nbutils.py, and autograde.py to your repository (where your nb/ directory is located), you can check your notebook answers with this command: sh python3 autograde.py

For the autograder to work, for each question, please include a line of comment at the beginning of code cell that outputs the answer. For example, the code cell for question 7 should look like ‚Äú`python q7

‚Ä¶ ‚Äú`
